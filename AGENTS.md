# Agent instructions for aether-wordpress-importer-cleanup

This file is the single source of agent instructions for this repository. Claude Code, Cursor and Codex all read it directly; there is no `CLAUDE.md`, because Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` only when `CLAUDE.md` is absent. Put instructions here, never in a `CLAUDE.md`.

Everything above the generated section below belongs to this repository and is edited here. The generated section is rewritten by the sync from `UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills`; edit the shared skills and rules there.

## About this repository

This PHP CLI library cleans WordPress WXR exports for import. It requires PHP 8.4 and DOM/libxml; development also needs mbstring, ZIP, and PCOV for mutation testing. No database, environment secrets, or long-running service is needed.

In an Amp orb, run `.agents/setup`. It is the shared script the sync delivers (the `orb` profile): it installs PHP 8.4, Composer 2 and Node 22 with each download verified, installs the locked dependencies, then runs `.agents/setup.local`, which holds this repository's own steps: replacing a stale ignored `composer.lock`, reapplying the committed mutation-tool patches, and enabling the tracked commit guard (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`). The library ignores `composer.lock`: a current generated lock is retained, and a tracked lock is never removed. `.agents/resume` is the shared wake check; it only checks the existing toolchain and dependencies, runs `.agents/resume.local` (PHP 8.4 with enabled PCOV, platform requirements), and never installs anything. Edit the shared files in `UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills`, never here. Both scripts are orb-only, not macOS or Windows host installers.

Run `composer test` for the ordinary suite, `composer test:pint` for formatting, `composer test:refactor` for the Rector dry run, and `composer stan` for static analysis. Run mutation checks through `composer mutate`, not a bare Pest invocation; its current scope and patch requirements are documented in `README.md` and `patches/README.md`.

## Shared skills and rules

The files listed here are synced from [UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills](https://github.com/UAMS-Web/uams-claude-skills) (`shared/`) and are edited there, never here; a sync pull request brings changes into this repository. This section is generated; everything outside it belongs to this repository.

Each rule below is a standing instruction for every task in this repository. Its full text is delivered three times: `.claude/rules/<name>.md`, which Claude Code loads in every session; `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc`, which Cursor always applies; and the skill `.agents/skills/rule-<name>/`, which Codex selects by its description. Before work a rule governs, read its full text. Skills are in `.claude/skills/` and, as the same files, in `.agents/skills/`, and load when their description matches the task.

Profiles for this repository: core, php, pest, tests, quality, orb.
